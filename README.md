 Design web pages with CSS
    f you can, imagine a time before the invention of the Internet. Websites didn’t exist, and books, printed on paper and tightly bound, were your primary source of information. It took a considerable amount of effort—and reading—to track down the exact piece of information you were after.

Today you can open a web browser, jump over to your search engine of choice, and search away. Any bit of imaginable information rests at your fingertips. And chances are someone somewhere has built a website with your exact search in mind.

Within this book I’m going to show you how to build your own websites using the two most dominant computer languages—HTML and CSS.

Before we begin our journey to learn how to build websites with HTML and CSS, it is important to understand the differences between the two languages, the syntax of each language, and some common terminology.

CSS | Colors
CSS Color property is used to set the color of HTML elements. This property is used to set font color, background color etc.

Color of an element can be defined in the following ways:

Built-In Color
RGB Format
RGBA Format
Hexadecimal Notation
HSL
HSLA
Built-In Color: These are a set of predefined colors which are used by its name. For example: red, blue, green etc.



Example:

<html> 
    <head> 
        <title>CSS RGBA color property</title> 
        <style> 
            h1 { 
                color:rgba(0, 153, 0, 0.5); 
                text-align:center; 
            } 
        </style> 
    </head> 
    <body> 
        <h1> 
            GeeksforGeeks 
        </h1> 
    </body> 
</html>
